Git uses git has a data structure called as

                   Tree

But in these case it is a Directed-Tree

     Directed-Graph    


and what it does


. it contains pointers using the hashes like it will

. store the hashes and use the hashes as pointers

. to store blobs (inside you'll be have details about the file)
. it can store trees also


# It has MetaData about

the type of pointers
two type of pointers
1 for blobs 1 for the trees

type of pointer (tree,blob)

--> directory name or file name

--> mode 

tree object look like

--------------------
|tree    |  <size>  |
|        |          |
|        |          |
|        |          |
|        |          |
|        |          |
|        |          |
 ------------------

in sense
there are some tree objects
which ponts to other tree objects
it then points to blob objects

intertrees which are refred are subtrees

all of these are directed graph

All starts when you do git add <file name>

it creates a blob and tree pointing to it

directed tree


# To Manages Directories Git Manages a Structured Called as Trees

SO inside Directory, you can have sub-directory inside sub-directory
you have files

when you do git add
it create a tree object 
inside it can point to blobs technically files and it can point to trees
which are technically other directories-
